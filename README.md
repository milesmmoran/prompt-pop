*Prompt Pop*
This is a simple script that I may use to see how one would share a command line tool. 

I was thinking that the command that is run should be flexible, such that you could really run any process on the temp file, and it's file content would become your buffer
after. 

I have a working version in my dotfiles, this is more to document how this would be shared in a flexible, portable way.
